# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to elfmsg!

## Ways to contribute
You could contribute to different parts of the project, i.e., project overview, project design, frontend design, and backend API. We appreciate each and every contribution.
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them in [Discussions](https://github.com/DuskyElf/elfmsg/discussions/6).

### Contributing ideas:
The easiest way to start contributing is by sharing ideas. You could discuss your ideas in [Discussions](https://github.com/DuskyElf/elfmsg/discussions).
or you could also start a
[feature request issue](https://github.com/DuskyElf/elfmsg/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) for a new feature request.

### Contributing in code:
Check [open issues](https://github.com/DuskyElf/elfmsg/issues) to contribute code; issues labelled as `good first issue` are generally easy to start from.
All workable issues have their own `branch` associated with them. Just leave a comment stating that you are working on the issue, and you're good to go.
Fork the repo, checkout the issue branch, make changes, and create a pull request to that issue branch.
Then your pull request would be reviewed by the maintainers and merged after approval.
