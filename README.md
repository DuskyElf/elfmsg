## Plans
- A web app, with [React-ts](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html) as frontend and [Rocket.rs](https://rocket.rs/) as backend.
- Flexible Server, ie. Users could host the server themselves.
- End-to-end encryption, ie. Server won't have control over messages.
- Switchable encryption algorithms, for using [Quantum Safe Encrypting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Post-Quantum_Cryptography_Standardization).
