Open, end-to-end encrypted messenger app

## Plans

- A web app, with [React-ts](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html) as frontend and [Rocket.rs](https://rocket.rs/) as backend.
- Flexible Server, ie. Users could host the server themselves.
- End-to-end encryption, ie. Server won't have control over messages.
- Switchable encryption algorithms, for using [Quantum Safe Encrypting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Post-Quantum_Cryptography_Standardization).

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DuskyElf/elfmsg.git
cd elfmsg
```

## Run Locally

```

To serve the client -

npm start
```
